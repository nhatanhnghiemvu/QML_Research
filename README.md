# Instruction on readout training data/ testing data/ training model
For Iris experiment, the trained model is `iris1_training_model100.txt'
Data can be generated from Python code

For Circles experiment, the trained model is `explicit_training_model100.txt'
The training data is `explicit_train_data_.txt'  -- the first 15 points are class 0 , the next 15 points are class 1
The testing data is `explicit_test_data_.txt' -- the first 50 points are class 0, the next 50 points are class 1
